    <h2>Cool Mini Ice Cream Cakes üç®üòÅ</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Ingredients!!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pints of desired ice cream flavor(s)</li>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>Brownie mix</li>
      <li>(optinal) zest from oranges</li>
      <li>(optional) 12 wafer cookies</li>
      <li>8 ounces of chocolae chips</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of coconut oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of sprinkles or candy</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>(BEFORE) Follow the directions of the brownie mix to create delicious brownies (can use a bit of orange zest for a tangy taste)</li>
      <li>Let the ice cream defrost at room temperature to soften, about 10 minutes. Use a standard 12-cup muffin tin and spray the wells with cooking spray. Cut 12 sqaures of plastic tinfoil/wrap and line each well with a square shape (The cooking spray helps the plastic wrap stick to the sides). </li>
      <li>Cut the brownie lengthwise into 1/2 inch wide planks. Use a 2 1/4-inch wide cookie cutter to cut the brownie 12 times. Then, place a brownie circle in each muffin well.</li>
      <li>Spoon the ice cream from the first pint over the brownie and spread into an even layer. If using, place 1 wafer cookie in each well on top of the ice cream (don't worry if the wafers break). Scoop ice cream from the second pint ove rthe first layer of ice cream or wafer and spread into an even layer. Place the muffin tin face up in the freezer and freeze until solid, at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>When you are ready to serve/eat make the toppings! Place the chocolate and coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on low setting in 30-wave intervals and stir between intervals, until it is melted and smooth. (Or you can melt on a stovetop)</li>
      <li>Grab the plastic wrap around the mini ice cream cake, and remove them from the pan. Remove and discard the tinfoil from the ice cream cakes and place the cakes brownie-side up. Spoon the chocolate sauce over the top of the cake, completly covering the top and let it drip down the sides. Sprinke 1/2 teaspoon of sprinlkes on top or place candy on top. Repeat the process with the remaining cakes (work with only a few cakes because the topping sauce hardens quickly). </li>
      <li>Serve your cool creation immediately!</li>
